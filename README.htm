Inspired by <a href='http://ambassadortothecomputers.blogspot.com/2011/04/logic-programming-in-scala-part-1.html'>this blog post</a>.  

This program reads a configuration file listing some people, and how long each
of them takes to cross the bridge, and solves the problem, indicating what is
the minimum amount of time the people can take to cross the bridge, and also
prints all the solutions.

First, update People.txt to contain the people and walking times you want.  A
line starting with #, or that otherwise can't be parsed reasonably, is ignored,
mostly.

The first time you run it, you need to do:

./sbt update

This will download scala.  After you've done that, you can run the program
(more quickly) like:

./sbt run

Enjoy,
Eric
